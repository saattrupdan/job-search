We value our different skills, perspectives and experiences and foster an environment where innovative powers thrive. To us, success is the feeling that the work we are doing will outlast us. The impact we make is not about what we achieve as individuals, but how we enable those around us to be their very best. From professional development to leadership opportunities, we empower our people to be extraordinary by playing to their strengths – because that is how we can make a difference.\\nWe, in the Systems Engineering department of Deloitte Consulting Denmark, are on the lookout for additional team-players for our quickly growing Custom Development practice.\\n\\nOur department consists of 60+ consultants, around 15 of which work as developers, of varying experience levels. We assist our clients on the implementation of new systems as part of their digital transformation. Our clients are based in all industries – public, finance, and transportation are our current strongholds.\\xa0\\n\\nExciting tasks await you!\\nTo thrive in Deloitte, you embrace working with varying tech-stacks and different aspects of development. Our client assignments are with some of the world’s most well-known companies and public agencies and can vary greatly, but most of the assignments fit into one of the below three categories. Common for all of them are that we strive to work with the technologies that the client prefers. Often, you will have a specialty within one of the three, but we provide you with the opportunity and tools needed to learn and grow within all of them.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nClient assignments will often have you work on the following:\\n\\nApplication development on solutions of all sizes, frequently in Agile settings (SAFE/Scrum). This includes both backend and frontend development, often directed towards public clouds or on-premises.\\nEnabling DevOps through development of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code.\\nTest automation on different levels (unit, integration, UI, end-to-end, data).\\n\\nBesides client work, consultants on all levels take part in internal tasks such as sales activities and further development of our organisation. The distribution between them depends on your seniority, role, and profile – and, of course, your own interests.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOrganisational development adds to our collective ability to perform well in the market. This could include:\\n\\nBuilding internal capabilities through community tasks, maybe within new business areas.\\nAssist on developing internal tools to make us even better.\\nJoin in on workshops/sales pitches as a domain specialist and contribute to proposals for new client projects\\n\\nHow do we work as developers in Deloitte?\\nWe work side-by-side with our clients through all stages of their systems transformation, e.g., analysis of as-is, envisioning to-be states, and implementing solutions. Technology-wise, the client assignments might bring us all the way from mainframes to serverless compute clouds, and our tasks might be anything from pure advising to hands-on implementation, depending on the project and your profile. As a developer within Systems Engineering, you will primarily be working on the actual implementation of various systems and solutions, whereas you have the option to steer your career towards more advisory-based roles as your seniority increases.\\n\\nWe seek developers who wish to become more than “just” a coding grunt. Coding is your craft, and of course you are excellent at it, but in Deloitte, we value an appetite for more: an appetite for influencing the systems and solutions that you are contributing to for the better. You should be prepared to participate in analysis and advising as well as development. Together, we will accelerate your career towards becoming a lead programmer or solution architect.\\n\\nDeloitte is only as good as its people. For that reason, several initiatives are in place to empower you throughout your career development. As a new employee, you are assigned a talent manager to support your career aspirations, and we urge frequent check-ins with senior co-workers on client projects to support your development. Additionally, we have a tech community with monthly meetings in which we share knowledge, investigate new topics, and upskill within relevant technologies and methodologies.\\n\\nOn the social aspect, Deloitte Consulting is second to none. We offer everything from various sports communities to festivals to internal hackathons - not to forget the yearly Consulting Trip where all levels get together off-site to create life lasting memories.\\n\\nAbout you\\n\\nProfessional experience coding in any language e.g. Java, C#/.Net, Python, C, C++, GO or JavaScript.\\nAs a skilled programmer, you have strong analytical skills and a focus on quality and detail.\\nPreferably, you have acquired a Master’s or Bachelor’s degree within Computer Science, Engineering, or similar.\\nYou have a high proficiency in written and spoken English. If you do not speak Danish fluently, you have preferably passed Prøve i Dansk 3 (PD3) with high grades and are able to work efficiently on a Danish-speaking project.\\n\\nClick the apply button above if you are ready to join our team. Send your CV and grade transcripts from your Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees as well as other relevant documents such as link to your GitHub. We process applications and arrange interviews continually, so we recommend that you apply as soon as possible.\\n\\nPlease do not hesitate to contact Anders Skovbo Gertsen at PHONE if you have any questions about the position.\\n\\nWe look forward to connecting with you!KeywordsArchitecture, Development, IT, Developer, Java, Agile, Backend, Frontend, Python, Programming, .Net, C#, JavaScript, Custom development, DevOps, Safe, Software, Integration, Scrum\\n\\nAbout this position \\n\\nCompany name \\nDeloitte Denmark\\n\\nWeidekampsgade 62300 København SWebpageURL FacebookLinkedIn@deloittedanmarkStart dateAugust 29 2022\\n\\nApplication deadline \\nApril 18 2022\\n\\nWorkplace\\nCopenhagen\\n\\nTitle\\nConsultant\\n\\nSector\\nPrivate\\n\\nPosition\\n\\nFull time \\n\\nExtent\\nPermanent\\n\\nNumber of positions\\n8\\n\\nAnders Skovbo EMAILPHONE \\n\\n///\\nDeloitte Denmark \\nIn Deloitte, you will find passionate, caring people who are curious by nature, striving to evolve.
