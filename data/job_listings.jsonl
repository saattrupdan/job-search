In fiber optics based SPR sensors, the penetration depth of the evanescent wave into the sample under investigation depends on the resonance wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the higher the penetration depth. However, current SPR sensors are limited to the visible wavelength region. This can be overcome by generating SPR in the mid-IR region with optical fibers and plasmonic materials suitable for this wavelength region. SRP in the mid-IR are ideal for a range of application such as for monitoring in real time dynamic changes taking place in living cells which is difficult to achieve in the visible wavelength region. In addition, mid-IR SPR sensors are expected to be biocompatible as Rayleigh scattering and photo-damage to the tissue in this wavelength region is reduced.\n\nAs the application is mainly focused on bio-sensing and applications in health science you will work closely with DTU Health Tech. \u00a0Our group, Fiber Sensors and Supercontinuum, is a world leader within the development and application of mid-IR supercontinuum sources, which is essential for mid-IR SPR excitation.\n\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nIn this project, your primary responsibility will be\n\nTo perform simulations to investigate mid-IR optical fiber-based SPR bio-sensors \nTo explore and implement appropriate plasmonic materials for mid-IR SPR excitation.\nTo develop a compact mid-IR SPR bio sensor.\nTo demonstrate applications that are challenging or impossible in the visible wavelength region such as monitoring in real time dynamic changes taking place in living cells.\nTo optimize the sensor structure to maximize the sensor sensitivity, resolution, limit of detection and sensing range.\n\nWe therefore require you to have strong expertise in simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics software and strong experimental qualifications within optical fiber technology. In addition, to have the drive to build things yourself and finish projects with high-profile publications. Documented experience in experimental or theoretical studies in the areas of SPR will be evaluated positively.\n\nA detailed project plan will be developed with the supervisors within the first three months after enrolment.\n\nYou must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.\n\nApproval and Enrolment\nThe scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education.\u00a0\n\nWe offer\nDTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility.\n\nSalary and appointment terms\nThe appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years.\n\nYou can read more about career paths at DTU here.\n\nFurther information\nFurther information may be obtained from Research Scientist Getinet Woyessa, gewoy@fotonik.dtu.dk, telephone +45 4525 5735.\n\nYou can read more about DTU Fotonik at www.fotonik.dtu.dk/english.\u00a0\n\nIf you are applying from abroad, you may find useful information on working in Denmark and at DTU at DTU \u2013 Moving to Denmark.\u00a0\n\nApplication procedure\nYour complete online application must be submitted no later than 1 May 2022 (Danish time).

Are you highly experienced in developing protein expression, refolding and purification processes from biotech or large pharma and want to use your capacity to catalyze a new cell therapy to cancer? \u2013 Then read on! \n\nAbout PokeAcell\n\n PokeAcell is an early stage biotech company with a proprietary technology for personalized T-cell therapy preparing for phase I clinical study. We are an experienced team of scientific and business leaders, founding PokeAcell with the vision to provide curative treatment to late-stage cancer patients, where no treatment is available today. Our T cell therapy hold the promise of curative treatment in Melanoma, Merkel Cell carcinoma and high mutational burden tumors targeting Neo antigens. \n\nThe position\n\n We are seeking an experienced scientist to drive process development and production of MHCs (Major Histocompatibility Complex), which is a core component in PokeAcells proprietary technology. The position is part of a larger clinical development project with multiple stakeholders, including Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The first year, process development will take place at DTU, where the process is anchored today and thereafter the process will be transferred to PokeAcell, where you will be responsible for establishing the internal manufacturing. Hence, you must be independent, detail-oriented and a highly experienced scientist with a proven background in protein expression, refolding and purification of proteins and a sustained passion for being in the lab. \n\n\n Your core responsibilities will be to: \n\n\nOptimize the production process, from production strains to expression\nOptimize refolding and purification to ensure high yield and removal of process-related impurities, e.g. endotoxins\nCharacterize and release the purified MHC monomers\nFacilitate transfer of the process to PokeAcell and establish a new MHC manufacturing setup within PokeAcell\nExecute experimental plans, analyze experimental data, maintain experimental results in relevant databases\nIn addition, you will shape PokeAcell together with us to establish a professional and cutting-edge cell therapy company. The position is located in Copenhagen, but during the first year most activities will be taking place at DTU in Lyngby\n\nQualifications\n\n You hold a PhD or MS degree in Biochemistry or Biochemical Engineering and have at least 5 to 10 years of experience from protein expression, refolding and purification at 5L scale or more. Preferably you have worked in, or in close collaboration with, a cGMP manufacturing unit. \n\n\n We are looking for a candidate with the following qualifications: \n\n\nDeep understanding of E.coli protein expression\nExperience in protein purification using FPLC, HPLC and/or UPLC chromatography and UF/DF\nEspecially experience with endotoxin removal maintaining a high purification yield\nExtensive experience in optimization of protein refolding processes\nMolecular biology experience with focus on optimizing protein expression constructs and production strains\nGood knowledge in protein characterization assays e.g. SDS PAGE, SEC-HPLC, protein functionality by flow cytometry.\nTechnical and operational expertise to ensure the delivery of high-quality MHC, data and statistical analysis and interpretation throughout project life\nAbility to trouble-shoot for process optimization and protein characterization.\n\n\n Additional experience of value: \n\n\nExperienced in the use of DOE statistical tools\nAs the process eventually will be scaled up, knowledge within regulatory requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) is an advantage.\n\nJoin us\n\n We offer you to become part of a fun and professional team, shaping the future of PokeAcell and creating curative treatment to cancer patients. Give us a call to discuss more if your heart is beating faster than usual and you are ready for a new endeavor. \n\nContact\n\n Reach out to CTO, Thomas Sandal at +45 2294 2918 or TS@pokeacell.com.

We were established in 2010, and in 2017 we moved into new laboratories, offices, and meeting rooms in the Maersk Tower www.maersktower.ku.dk.\nThe Center has around 260 employees who work in an international, highly collaborative research environment across a range of biomedical disciplines. You can read more about us here: www.cbmr.ku.dk.\nOur Research\nIn the Treebak Group, we aim to define mechanisms linking cellular NAD+ to metabolic health. We want to understand the role of the NAD+ generating and consuming pathways for maintaining tissue function and adaptability in response to metabolic stress. We employ innovative preclinical models to manipulate NAD-related metabolites cell type-specifically and determine functional implications. We have developed several novel and unique experimental models and techniques related to in vivo animal research. Moreover, we apply unbiased omics approaches and analytical pipelines in collaboration with key national and international partners to identify responsible mediators and to determine genotype/phenotype interactions. We are highly motivated and self-driven with a passion for metabolic research. We are part of a strong interdisciplinary, supportive, and diverse environment at CBMR, and we believe that teamwork and engagement are key elements for scientific success. Link to the Treebak Group: https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/integrative-metabolism-and-environmental-influences/treebakgroup/\nJob Description\nThe successful candidate will be involved in a project with the overall aim to determine the importance of the NAD+ biosynthesis capacity of satellite cells for the ability of skeletal muscle to recover from injury. We have generated several transgenic mouse models in which levels of Nampt in satellite cells can be manipulated, and we are currently setting up experimental conditions to induce muscle injury either chemically or via eccentric muscle contractions. Your tasks will be to refine these protocols and use the mouse models to determine whether manipulation of NAD+ in satellite cells affects muscle recovery. You will complement these studies by in vitro experiments in isolated mouse and human satellite cells to determine critical NAD+-dependent nodal points for satellite cell proliferation and differentiation using advanced cell imaging systems. You will be part of a dynamic and highly collaborative research team that strives for scientific excellence, and works for similar overall goals. We rely on each other in practical day-to-day settings as well as for scientific development of the projects. We expect you to carry this team spirit, and at the same time you will be given a high level of independence to drive and develop this project.\nProfile\nThe fellowship is aimed at early career researchers with a basic science background or clinicians who aspire to a career in academic medicine.

We were established in 2010, and in 2017 we moved into new laboratories, offices and meeting rooms in the Maersk Tower www.maersktower.ku.dk.\nThe Center has around 260 employees who work in an international, highly collaborative research environment across a range of biomedical disciplines. You can read more about us here: www.cbmr.ku.dk.\nOur Research\nWe are focused on understanding the mechanisms controlling adipose tissue metabolism and how this control shapes organismal energy homeostasis. Specifically, we view the adipocyte as a signalling hub that receives and integrates a diverse array of neuronal, metabolite, and hormonal cues. These signals collectively shape adipocyte biology and match metabolic output to balance systemic energy demands. Brown and beige adipocytes are types of fat cells that possess a profound capacity to expend energy and are classified more generally as thermogenic adipocytes. This calorie-burning capacity is particularly appealing as a potential therapeutic approach to counteract metabolic disease. However, we currently lack the means of safely harnessing thermogenic adipose activity.\nIn this project, we will directly address this gap-in-knowledge by exploring novel mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) control of human thermogenic adipose in close collaboration with Professor Erik Richter, Associate Professor Steen Larsen, Associate Professor Camilla Sch\u00e9ele, and Professor Thue Schwartz at the University of Copenhagen. We will take advantage of a battery of interdisciplinary, big data approaches to identify candidate regulators. We will then apply state-of-the-art phenotyping and pharmacological strategies to characterize the physiological role of such candidates in adipose metabolism. Where possible, we will leverage our basic research findings toward the development of novel innovative treatment strategies.\nFind out more about the Gerhart-Hines lab here:\u00a0https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/nutrient-and-metabolite-sensing/gerhart-hines-group/\nJob Description\nWe seek an enthusiastic, passionate scientist with medical training who is interested in applying their expertise to the discovery and characterization of new adipose GPCR signalling mechanisms. You will have the opportunity to learn and apply a variety of clinical techniques, such as tissue microdialysis sampling. You will interrogate candidate GPCR signalling in mouse and human adipocytes as well as adipose-specific mouse models using an array of pharmacological and metabolic phenotyping strategies.\nProfile\nThe fellowship is aimed at early career researchers with a basic science background or clinicians who aspire to a career in academic medicine. We are particularly interested in candidates who are familiar with integrative research approaches within the broad area of basic metabolic research with an application towards human pathophysiology.\nRequired qualifications:\n\nPh.D. in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, or related sciences\nM.D. \nExcellent scientific track record in relation to career stage\nProfound knowledge of adipose tissue biology and metabolic disease\nKnowledge of GPCR signalling and pharmacology\nExperience with writing clinical protocols and biopsy techniques (such as the Bergstr\u00f6m method)\nExcellent English communication skills, both written and oral\n\nEligibility\nThe CBMR International Postdoctoral Program is open for applicants that hold a PhD degree awarded from a university outside of Denmark. The PhD degree must be obtained before October 1, 2022.

This position will allow you to build on a career as an independent scientist within MRI with own project management in a team of passionate and ambitious researchers.\n\nHyperpolarized 13C MRI is a medical imaging technology that enables non-invasive metabolic imaging of the human body. The research field is in rapid development at multiple top ranked institutions, where, among other research activities, many clinical trials are ongoing, demonstrating the relevance of hyperpolarized 13C MRI to the diagnosis and treatment planning of a wide range of diseases. Furthermore, because of the non-invasive nature of the method, it is also being tested in trials with healthy volunteers with special interest in healthy brain metabolism.\n\nOur research center, Hypermag (center for hyperpolarization in magnetic resonance), stands as a flagship within the research field. Our research activities span from polarizer hardware development to hyperpolarized NMR of pathogens and MR imaging of large animals and humans. We are highly interdisciplinary, but strongly connected by common fundamental methods and long-term goals of patient impact and benefit. We are therefore well placed in the Department of Health Technology at DTU and contributes to the department\u2019s overall objective of technology development for human health and well-being.\n\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nYour main focus will be to develop magnetic resonance sequences and reconstruction methods along with required practical framework at DTU to enable hyperpolarized metabolic imaging of the healthy human brain.\n\nThe brain is a highly metabolic organ and metabolic impairment plays a central role in most brain diseases. A better understanding of \u201cbaseline metabolism\u201d of the healthy brain can therefore potentially both expand our knowledge of healthy brain mechanisms, such as memory and aging, as well as guide preventative measures, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment response for patients.\n\nIn spring 2022 a clinical GE MR scanner will be installed at DTU Health Tech. The first MR scanner at DTU. This provides the opportunity to apply hyperpolarized 13C MRI for an unprecedented picture of brain metabolism. With the new scanner, we need to build up local protocols, ethics, and strategies for both pre-clinical imaging and for imaging of healthy volunteers building on experience from national and international collaborators. You will be an active contributor in this regard.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWe expect you to have strong experience within the field of MR imaging and spectroscopy and to have practical experience with MR sequence development and MR scanning on a GE scanner. Experience with hyperpolarized MRI and multi-nuclear MRI is a pre-requisite. Methods development will be carried out using phantoms and research animals (rodents and pigs). You are also expected to support local coil development with imaging and quality assurance.\n\nAs a postdoc in the section for magnetic resonance you are expected to:\n\nContribute to research-based education of bachelor and master students\nCo-supervise PhD students\nTake responsibility for project coordination and performance on the 3T clinical scanner\nDrive the above-described research field towards clinical translation\nDevelop and maintain active collaboration with national and international MRI communities\nContribute actively to social-scientific events (e.g. journal clubs and workshops) \n\nAs a formal qualification, you must hold a PhD degree (or equivalent).

Benefited from the high working bandwidth and the compact size of the Blu-ray OPU, the Dermal AFM is expected to perform ten times higher throughput than conventional AFMs and is easy to use in clinical environments. The project is coordinated from Department of Health Technology (DTU Health Tech) and is performed in collaboration with hospitals in Denmark, Netherlands and Taiwan for (AD) severity assessment and skin sample acquisition. Different regions AD nanotexture data (Europe and Asia) facilitate optimization of AD assessment in a subclinical phase, as well as courses and pharmacotherapy effectiveness quantitatively. It is highly possible to commercialize the Dermal AFM when the measurement result fulfills the clinical need.

We have pioneered a unique OPU based AFM instrumentation and we would like to integrate DTI analysis for skin barrier function assessment in this project.\n\nThe postdoctoral researcher will work on the AFM scanner, imaging sensor, OPU hardware interfacing circuits, software control of the measurement, simple AFM data treatment and DTI integration.
