In fiber optics based SPR sensors, the penetration depth of the evanescent wave into the sample under investigation depends on the resonance wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the higher the penetration depth. However, current SPR sensors are limited to the visible wavelength region. This can be overcome by generating SPR in the mid-IR region with optical fibers and plasmonic materials suitable for this wavelength region. SRP in the mid-IR are ideal for a range of application such as for monitoring in real time dynamic changes taking place in living cells which is difficult to achieve in the visible wavelength region. In addition, mid-IR SPR sensors are expected to be biocompatible as Rayleigh scattering and photo-damage to the tissue in this wavelength region is reduced.\n\nAs the application is mainly focused on bio-sensing and applications in health science you will work closely with DTU Health Tech. \u00a0Our group, Fiber Sensors and Supercontinuum, is a world leader within the development and application of mid-IR supercontinuum sources, which is essential for mid-IR SPR excitation.\n\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nIn this project, your primary responsibility will be\n\nTo perform simulations to investigate mid-IR optical fiber-based SPR bio-sensors \nTo explore and implement appropriate plasmonic materials for mid-IR SPR excitation.\nTo develop a compact mid-IR SPR bio sensor.\nTo demonstrate applications that are challenging or impossible in the visible wavelength region such as monitoring in real time dynamic changes taking place in living cells.\nTo optimize the sensor structure to maximize the sensor sensitivity, resolution, limit of detection and sensing range.\n\nWe therefore require you to have strong expertise in simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics software and strong experimental qualifications within optical fiber technology. In addition, to have the drive to build things yourself and finish projects with high-profile publications. Documented experience in experimental or theoretical studies in the areas of SPR will be evaluated positively.\n\nA detailed project plan will be developed with the supervisors within the first three months after enrolment.\n\nYou must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.\n\nApproval and Enrolment\nThe scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education.\u00a0\n\nWe offer\nDTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility.\n\nSalary and appointment terms\nThe appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years.\n\nYou can read more about career paths at DTU here.\n\nFurther information\nFurther information may be obtained from Research Scientist Getinet Woyessa, gewoy@fotonik.dtu.dk, telephone +45 4525 5735.\n\nYou can read more about DTU Fotonik at www.fotonik.dtu.dk/english.\u00a0\n\nIf you are applying from abroad, you may find useful information on working in Denmark and at DTU at DTU \u2013 Moving to Denmark.\u00a0\n\nApplication procedure\nYour complete online application must be submitted no later than 1 May 2022 (Danish time).

Are you highly experienced in developing protein expression, refolding and purification processes from biotech or large pharma and want to use your capacity to catalyze a new cell therapy to cancer? \u2013 Then read on! \n\nAbout PokeAcell\n\n PokeAcell is an early stage biotech company with a proprietary technology for personalized T-cell therapy preparing for phase I clinical study. We are an experienced team of scientific and business leaders, founding PokeAcell with the vision to provide curative treatment to late-stage cancer patients, where no treatment is available today. Our T cell therapy hold the promise of curative treatment in Melanoma, Merkel Cell carcinoma and high mutational burden tumors targeting Neo antigens. \n\nThe position\n\n We are seeking an experienced scientist to drive process development and production of MHCs (Major Histocompatibility Complex), which is a core component in PokeAcells proprietary technology. The position is part of a larger clinical development project with multiple stakeholders, including Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The first year, process development will take place at DTU, where the process is anchored today and thereafter the process will be transferred to PokeAcell, where you will be responsible for establishing the internal manufacturing. Hence, you must be independent, detail-oriented and a highly experienced scientist with a proven background in protein expression, refolding and purification of proteins and a sustained passion for being in the lab. \n\n\n Your core responsibilities will be to: \n\n\nOptimize the production process, from production strains to expression\nOptimize refolding and purification to ensure high yield and removal of process-related impurities, e.g. endotoxins\nCharacterize and release the purified MHC monomers\nFacilitate transfer of the process to PokeAcell and establish a new MHC manufacturing setup within PokeAcell\nExecute experimental plans, analyze experimental data, maintain experimental results in relevant databases\nIn addition, you will shape PokeAcell together with us to establish a professional and cutting-edge cell therapy company. The position is located in Copenhagen, but during the first year most activities will be taking place at DTU in Lyngby\n\nQualifications\n\n You hold a PhD or MS degree in Biochemistry or Biochemical Engineering and have at least 5 to 10 years of experience from protein expression, refolding and purification at 5L scale or more. Preferably you have worked in, or in close collaboration with, a cGMP manufacturing unit. \n\n\n We are looking for a candidate with the following qualifications: \n\n\nDeep understanding of E.coli protein expression\nExperience in protein purification using FPLC, HPLC and/or UPLC chromatography and UF/DF\nEspecially experience with endotoxin removal maintaining a high purification yield\nExtensive experience in optimization of protein refolding processes\nMolecular biology experience with focus on optimizing protein expression constructs and production strains\nGood knowledge in protein characterization assays e.g. SDS PAGE, SEC-HPLC, protein functionality by flow cytometry.\nTechnical and operational expertise to ensure the delivery of high-quality MHC, data and statistical analysis and interpretation throughout project life\nAbility to trouble-shoot for process optimization and protein characterization.\n\n\n Additional experience of value: \n\n\nExperienced in the use of DOE statistical tools\nAs the process eventually will be scaled up, knowledge within regulatory requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) is an advantage.\n\nJoin us\n\n We offer you to become part of a fun and professional team, shaping the future of PokeAcell and creating curative treatment to cancer patients. Give us a call to discuss more if your heart is beating faster than usual and you are ready for a new endeavor. \n\nContact\n\n Reach out to CTO, Thomas Sandal at +45 2294 2918 or TS@pokeacell.com.

We were established in 2010, and in 2017 we moved into new laboratories, offices, and meeting rooms in the Maersk Tower www.maersktower.ku.dk.\nThe Center has around 260 employees who work in an international, highly collaborative research environment across a range of biomedical disciplines. You can read more about us here: www.cbmr.ku.dk.\nOur Research\nIn the Treebak Group, we aim to define mechanisms linking cellular NAD+ to metabolic health. We want to understand the role of the NAD+ generating and consuming pathways for maintaining tissue function and adaptability in response to metabolic stress. We employ innovative preclinical models to manipulate NAD-related metabolites cell type-specifically and determine functional implications. We have developed several novel and unique experimental models and techniques related to in vivo animal research. Moreover, we apply unbiased omics approaches and analytical pipelines in collaboration with key national and international partners to identify responsible mediators and to determine genotype/phenotype interactions. We are highly motivated and self-driven with a passion for metabolic research. We are part of a strong interdisciplinary, supportive, and diverse environment at CBMR, and we believe that teamwork and engagement are key elements for scientific success. Link to the Treebak Group: https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/integrative-metabolism-and-environmental-influences/treebakgroup/\nJob Description\nThe successful candidate will be involved in a project with the overall aim to determine the importance of the NAD+ biosynthesis capacity of satellite cells for the ability of skeletal muscle to recover from injury. We have generated several transgenic mouse models in which levels of Nampt in satellite cells can be manipulated, and we are currently setting up experimental conditions to induce muscle injury either chemically or via eccentric muscle contractions. Your tasks will be to refine these protocols and use the mouse models to determine whether manipulation of NAD+ in satellite cells affects muscle recovery. You will complement these studies by in vitro experiments in isolated mouse and human satellite cells to determine critical NAD+-dependent nodal points for satellite cell proliferation and differentiation using advanced cell imaging systems. You will be part of a dynamic and highly collaborative research team that strives for scientific excellence, and works for similar overall goals. We rely on each other in practical day-to-day settings as well as for scientific development of the projects. We expect you to carry this team spirit, and at the same time you will be given a high level of independence to drive and develop this project.\nProfile\nThe fellowship is aimed at early career researchers with a basic science background or clinicians who aspire to a career in academic medicine.

We were established in 2010, and in 2017 we moved into new laboratories, offices and meeting rooms in the Maersk Tower www.maersktower.ku.dk.\nThe Center has around 260 employees who work in an international, highly collaborative research environment across a range of biomedical disciplines. You can read more about us here: www.cbmr.ku.dk.\nOur Research\nWe are focused on understanding the mechanisms controlling adipose tissue metabolism and how this control shapes organismal energy homeostasis. Specifically, we view the adipocyte as a signalling hub that receives and integrates a diverse array of neuronal, metabolite, and hormonal cues. These signals collectively shape adipocyte biology and match metabolic output to balance systemic energy demands. Brown and beige adipocytes are types of fat cells that possess a profound capacity to expend energy and are classified more generally as thermogenic adipocytes. This calorie-burning capacity is particularly appealing as a potential therapeutic approach to counteract metabolic disease. However, we currently lack the means of safely harnessing thermogenic adipose activity.\nIn this project, we will directly address this gap-in-knowledge by exploring novel mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) control of human thermogenic adipose in close collaboration with Professor Erik Richter, Associate Professor Steen Larsen, Associate Professor Camilla Sch\u00e9ele, and Professor Thue Schwartz at the University of Copenhagen. We will take advantage of a battery of interdisciplinary, big data approaches to identify candidate regulators. We will then apply state-of-the-art phenotyping and pharmacological strategies to characterize the physiological role of such candidates in adipose metabolism. Where possible, we will leverage our basic research findings toward the development of novel innovative treatment strategies.\nFind out more about the Gerhart-Hines lab here:\u00a0https://cbmr.ku.dk/research/nutrient-and-metabolite-sensing/gerhart-hines-group/\nJob Description\nWe seek an enthusiastic, passionate scientist with medical training who is interested in applying their expertise to the discovery and characterization of new adipose GPCR signalling mechanisms. You will have the opportunity to learn and apply a variety of clinical techniques, such as tissue microdialysis sampling. You will interrogate candidate GPCR signalling in mouse and human adipocytes as well as adipose-specific mouse models using an array of pharmacological and metabolic phenotyping strategies.\nProfile\nThe fellowship is aimed at early career researchers with a basic science background or clinicians who aspire to a career in academic medicine. We are particularly interested in candidates who are familiar with integrative research approaches within the broad area of basic metabolic research with an application towards human pathophysiology.\nRequired qualifications:\n\nPh.D. in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, or related sciences\nM.D. \nExcellent scientific track record in relation to career stage\nProfound knowledge of adipose tissue biology and metabolic disease\nKnowledge of GPCR signalling and pharmacology\nExperience with writing clinical protocols and biopsy techniques (such as the Bergstr\u00f6m method)\nExcellent English communication skills, both written and oral\n\nEligibility\nThe CBMR International Postdoctoral Program is open for applicants that hold a PhD degree awarded from a university outside of Denmark. The PhD degree must be obtained before October 1, 2022.

This position will allow you to build on a career as an independent scientist within MRI with own project management in a team of passionate and ambitious researchers.\n\nHyperpolarized 13C MRI is a medical imaging technology that enables non-invasive metabolic imaging of the human body. The research field is in rapid development at multiple top ranked institutions, where, among other research activities, many clinical trials are ongoing, demonstrating the relevance of hyperpolarized 13C MRI to the diagnosis and treatment planning of a wide range of diseases. Furthermore, because of the non-invasive nature of the method, it is also being tested in trials with healthy volunteers with special interest in healthy brain metabolism.\n\nOur research center, Hypermag (center for hyperpolarization in magnetic resonance), stands as a flagship within the research field. Our research activities span from polarizer hardware development to hyperpolarized NMR of pathogens and MR imaging of large animals and humans. We are highly interdisciplinary, but strongly connected by common fundamental methods and long-term goals of patient impact and benefit. We are therefore well placed in the Department of Health Technology at DTU and contributes to the department\u2019s overall objective of technology development for human health and well-being.\n\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nYour main focus will be to develop magnetic resonance sequences and reconstruction methods along with required practical framework at DTU to enable hyperpolarized metabolic imaging of the healthy human brain.\n\nThe brain is a highly metabolic organ and metabolic impairment plays a central role in most brain diseases. A better understanding of \u201cbaseline metabolism\u201d of the healthy brain can therefore potentially both expand our knowledge of healthy brain mechanisms, such as memory and aging, as well as guide preventative measures, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment response for patients.\n\nIn spring 2022 a clinical GE MR scanner will be installed at DTU Health Tech. The first MR scanner at DTU. This provides the opportunity to apply hyperpolarized 13C MRI for an unprecedented picture of brain metabolism. With the new scanner, we need to build up local protocols, ethics, and strategies for both pre-clinical imaging and for imaging of healthy volunteers building on experience from national and international collaborators. You will be an active contributor in this regard.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWe expect you to have strong experience within the field of MR imaging and spectroscopy and to have practical experience with MR sequence development and MR scanning on a GE scanner. Experience with hyperpolarized MRI and multi-nuclear MRI is a pre-requisite. Methods development will be carried out using phantoms and research animals (rodents and pigs). You are also expected to support local coil development with imaging and quality assurance.\n\nAs a postdoc in the section for magnetic resonance you are expected to:\n\nContribute to research-based education of bachelor and master students\nCo-supervise PhD students\nTake responsibility for project coordination and performance on the 3T clinical scanner\nDrive the above-described research field towards clinical translation\nDevelop and maintain active collaboration with national and international MRI communities\nContribute actively to social-scientific events (e.g. journal clubs and workshops) \n\nAs a formal qualification, you must hold a PhD degree (or equivalent).

Benefited from the high working bandwidth and the compact size of the Blu-ray OPU, the Dermal AFM is expected to perform ten times higher throughput than conventional AFMs and is easy to use in clinical environments. The project is coordinated from Department of Health Technology (DTU Health Tech) and is performed in collaboration with hospitals in Denmark, Netherlands and Taiwan for (AD) severity assessment and skin sample acquisition. Different regions AD nanotexture data (Europe and Asia) facilitate optimization of AD assessment in a subclinical phase, as well as courses and pharmacotherapy effectiveness quantitatively. It is highly possible to commercialize the Dermal AFM when the measurement result fulfills the clinical need.

We have pioneered a unique OPU based AFM instrumentation and we would like to integrate DTI analysis for skin barrier function assessment in this project.\n\nThe postdoctoral researcher will work on the AFM scanner, imaging sensor, OPU hardware interfacing circuits, software control of the measurement, simple AFM data treatment and DTI integration.

We need alternative green solutions to protect our crops to secure food and feed production. The focus of the EcoSap and SapFate projects is to learn from nature how to protect a future sustainable food production system. We have identified a class of compounds called saponins that can target insect species that are resistant to most synthetic insecticides. The project goes from basic science of how saponins are biosynthesized, stored, their mode of actions to exploring the possibilities of upscaled production of saponins, to their ecotoxicological evaluations and to understand the fate of saponins if applied as biopesticides to soil environments. You will therefore be working together in a multidisciplinary team with specialist within plant specialized metabolites, plant biochemistry, soil chemistry, ecotoxicology, membrane physiology, and microbiology. EcoSap and SAP-FATE are at the very forefront of the Green Transition agenda, and will contribute to positioning plant specialized metabolites as a logical approach to support productivity and resilience of agricultural production systems. \nPosition 1: Key scientific qualification areas\nThe ideal candidate has a background in biochemistry and molecular biology.\nThe aim of this positions is to expand our molecular tool box for genes encoding for enzymes in saponins biosynthesis.

You will be working with state-of-the-art technical equipment \u2013 a clinical 3T MRI scanner equipped with hyperpolarization \u2013 to study the metabolically declining brain non-invasively and in real-time with the aim to translate methodologies to the clinic.\n\nBackground\nMetabolic imaging is an attractive tool for the study of integrative physiology as it provides the means to measure cellular function in vivo in single cells, tissue, organs or organisms. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a widely used imaging method for studying in vivo metabolism non-invasively. Adding hyperpolarization in the form of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) to the MRS enhances the MR signal and allows us to trace healthy and aberrant metabolism specifically through biochemical conversion of the contrast agent in vivo. The MR signal enhancement of the metabolic contrast agent translates generally into reduction of hours long scan times and/or better resolution and most importantly can add dynamical information to the metabolic images. Hyperpolarized MR is currently (using specific endogenous molecules as metabolic contrast agent) translated to human studies with several early-phase clinical trials in progress including early reports showing 13C-pyruvate to 13C-lactate metabolism in healthy human brain.\n\nAt Hypermag in the section for magnetic resonance at DTU Health Tech we are experts in hyperpolarized MR and we will during spring 2022 install a clinical 3T MR scanner at DTU. We are therefore looking for you if you are interested in new technology, imaging and brain metabolism and are willing to work hard in a dedicated team of colleagues to make hyperpolarized MR at DTU a method for clinical translational metabolic research.\n\nResponsibilities and tasks\nThis PhD project aims at investigating causal links between metabolic syndrome (MetS), neuro-inflammation, neuro-metabolism and neurodegenerative disorders. We will study this in a physiological context relevant for clinical translation. Specifically in diet-induced obesity in a pig model that validly mimics the human diet-induced obese /MetS condition. In particular, the Ossabaw pig breed available at DTU Health Tech will be used as model system.\n\nIn the PhD project the set-up and tests of all tools needed to successfully conduct valuable biological studies will be implemented and evaluated in collaboration with team members in the brain metabolism group. Those tools include optimal spectroscopic sequences, a multi-nuclei head coil, hyperpolarized 13C-tracer production and injection protocols and anesthetic and monitoring protocols.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs a PhD student in the section for magnetic resonance you are expected to:\n\nContribute to research-based education of bachelor and master students\nTake responsibility, as a member of the brain metabolism group, for high quality performance on instrumentation for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy and on the 3T clinical scanner\n3-6 months exchange visit to one of our international collaborators who are frontrunners on hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy\nEngage in collaborations across DTU Health Tech and between metabolism and MR groups at KU Pharma and \u00c5rhus University hospital.\n\nQualifications\nThese contributions require a combination of interests and skills, and we are specifically looking for a person who has\n\nExperience with data analysis \nFlair for and interest in experimental work\nInterest in metabolic imaging\nExperience with Matlab or Python programming, or other relevant software for hardware control and data modelling\nGood self- and project management skills\n\nIt is necessary for an applicant for this interdisciplinary project to be naturally interested and take active participation in these connected scientific research fields related to the project: metabolism, biochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology.\n\nYou must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.\n\nApproval and Enrolment\nThe scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.

TIC is expected to grow organically by gradually establishing open access to state-of-the-art imaging equipment. We will do this by making groundbreaking DTU bio-imaging technology and knowledge available through project collaboration and by creating strong accessible networks to regional hospitals and industry.\n\nMedical imaging is pivotal in studying the inner workings of the human body non-invasively and a bioimaging infrastructure should be made available to all departments at DTU. TIC is administered from Department of Health Technology (DTU Health Tech) due to our wide knowledge base in a range of physical principles including x-rays, ultrasound, light, magnetic resonance and electrical signals and our common purpose to provide better healthcare solutions for the benefit of society and patients.\n\nTIC will house several activities: \n\nClinical 3T Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for non-invasive imaging of biochemical processes in living systems \nClinical ultrasound for 3D flow, pressure gradients and estimation, super resolution to study the microvasculature in real-time on humans \nClinical optical imaging for functional optical imaging and microscopy for deep tissue imaging, multimodal imaging for non-invasive cancer diagnostics, guiding surgery and tissue resection, opto-acoustics imaging for deep tissue imaging\nSmall animal fluorescence and bioluminescence, SPECT/PET/CT for contrast agent development and drug delivery\n\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nYour focus will be on gradually building up and correspondingly putting in place infrastructure (equipment and tools around these), access and behavioral rules for daily management in a growing imaging facility.\n\nYou will be working closely together with the head of the translational imaging center in all aspects around building the facility.\n\nWith new imaging equipment we need to build up local protocols, ethics, and strategies for pre-clinical imaging of small and larger animals. You will be an active contributor in this work.\n\nWe are a new facility with growth ambition, and we are dependent on good and collaborative interaction with surrounding established DTU facilities and departments. We thus expect you to bridge competences and interests between different parts of the DTU organization and DTU Health Tech, especially to the Animal Facility and to Campus Service.\n\nIt is our ambition to become a bio-imaging facility for all DTU and to create ownership and interest for the diverse imaging technologies by linking up to the strong knowledge base within our Health Technology department. You are therefore expected to work together with appointed experts in imaging methods and expert users of imaging equipment to create units of expertise around each technology in the facility. This will involve creating means of user sharing and expert teaching for user groups.\n\nWe expect you to have experience with building up an imaging facility and to have practical experience with training of colleagues, maintenance of imaging equipment, writing SOPs and standard protocols for equipment use. Strong experience with all types of daily operations in an animal facility is a pre-requisite. If you have experience and interest in surgical work on larger animals, this will be regarded as a plus. Also, it will be highly valuable if you are accredited to work with radioactive isotopes.\n\nWe are seeking a new facility manager for the Translational imaging Center at DTU with the following competencies: \n\nAt least 5 years of practical experience with procedures and care for animals in research\nAdministrative and practical experience as facility manager\nSolution-oriented \nEagerness to bring the competencies of others into play\nCapacity to balance of work that involves both routine and creative tasks\nWork with trust and responsibility as key values\n\nIn return we offer you the privilege of working in a small team with large ambitions and positive energy. A team that cares highly about relations (internal and external to the team) and where we work with trust, telling and sharing as our work compass.\u00a0\n\nAs an employee at DTU Health Tech, we offer you an interesting and challenging job in an international atmosphere with the focus on research, teaching, innovation and scientific advice for the benefit of the surrounding community. We place emphasis on a high level of professionalism among our staff, so development of skills is an integral part of our organization. We offer a great flexibility in the position.\n\nSalary and appointment terms\nSalary and employment terms in accordance with the OAO-S Joint Agreement and the organization agreement for Engineering Assistants and Research Technicians at research institutions etc. or other relevant organization agreement. Starting date is as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\nApplication and contact\nPlease submit your online application no later than 18 April 2022 (Danish time). Open the \u201cApply online\u201d link, fill out the form and attach your motivated application, CV and exam certificates.\u00a0\n\nIf you would like additional information about the position, please contact Head of TIC, Mathilde Hauge Lerche, on phone 5362 4555.\n\nApplications received after the deadline will not be considered.\n\nAll interested candidates irrespective of age, gender, race, disability, religion or ethnic background are encouraged to apply.\n\nDTU Health Tech engages in research, education, and innovation base on technical and natural science for the healthcare sector.

looking for an experienced and skilled hands-on facility manager who will help us build an open access, cross-modal bioimaging infrastructure at dtu.\nour vision for the translational imaging center (tic) is to create an excellent infrastructure for research, education and innovation in, and with, advanced bioimaging technologies. tic is expected to grow organically by gradually establishing open access to state-of-the-art imaging equipment. we will do this by making groundbreaking dtu bio-imaging technology and knowledge available through project collaboration and by creating strong accessible networks to regional hospitals and industry.\nmedical imaging is pivotal in studying the inner workings of the human body non-invasively and a bioimaging infrastructure should be made available to all departments at dtu. tic is administered from department of health technology (dtu health tech) due to our wide knowledge base in a range of physical principles including x-rays, ultrasound, light, magnetic resonance and electrical signals and our common purpose to provide better healthcare solutions for the benefit of society and patients.\ntic will house several activities:\nclinical 3t magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for non-invasive imaging of biochemical processes in living systems\nclinical ultrasound for 3d flow, pressure gradients and estimation, super resolution to study the microvasculature in real-time on humans\nclinical optical imaging for functional optical imaging and microscopy for deep tissue imaging, multimodal imaging for non-invasive cancer diagnostics, guiding surgery and tissue resection, opto-acoustics imaging for deep tissue imaging\nsmall animal fluorescence and bioluminescence, spect/pet/ct for contrast agent development and drug delivery\nyour focus will be on gradually building up and correspondingly putting in place infrastructure (equipment and tools around these), access and behavioral rules for daily management in a growing imaging facility.\nyou will be working closely together with the head of the translational imaging center in all aspects around building the facility.\nwith new imaging equipment we need to build up local protocols, ethics, and strategies for pre-clinical imaging of small and larger animals. you will be an active contributor in this work.\nwe are a new facility with growth ambition, and we are dependent on good and collaborative interaction with surrounding established dtu facilities and departments. we thus expect you to bridge competences and interests between different parts of the dtu organization and dtu health tech, especially to the animal facility and to campus service.\nit is our ambition to become a bio-imaging facility for all dtu and to create ownership and interest for the diverse imaging technologies by linking up to the strong knowledge base within our health technology department. you are therefore expected to work together with appointed experts in imaging methods and expert users of imaging equipment to create units of expertise around each technology in the facility. this will involve creating means of user sharing and expert teaching for user groups.\nwe expect you to have experience with building up an imaging facility and to have practical experience with training of colleagues, maintenance of imaging equipment, writing sops and standard protocols for equipment use. strong experience with all types of daily operations in an animal facility is a pre-requisite. if you have experience and interest in surgical work on larger animals, this will be regarded as a plus. also, it will be highly valuable if you are accredited to work with radioactive isotopes.\nat least 5 years of practical experience with procedures and care for animals in research\nadministrative and practical experience as facility manager\neagerness to bring the competencies of others into play\ncapacity to balance of work that involves both routine and creative tasks\nwork with trust and responsibility as key values\nin return we offer you the privilege of working in a small team with large ambitions and positive energy. a team that cares highly about relations (internal and external to the team) and where we work with trust, telling and sharing as our work compass.\nas an employee at dtu health tech, we offer you an

The future demand of ammonia is expected to increase, not only due to population growth, but also because ammonia is considered a potential low emission fuel for global shipping. Hence, more efficient synthesis processes associated with no or reduced emissions will be key to realizing climate policy goals. It is highly advantageous if novel ammonia synthesis routes can be down scaled and are compliant with the characteristics of the future energy system, where electricity cost and availability will vary due to fluctuating production.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nResponsibilities and qualifications\nThe successful candidate will work on developing and experimentally verifying novel routes to the synthesis of ammonia. Focus will be on process schemes that can be applied at small scale and are primarily driven by electricity and will enable ammonia synthesis at lower temperature and pressure than state of the art today. Within the framework of V-SUSTAIN it has recently been found that ternary hydrides (Li/Ba-Ru-hydrides) offer markedly improved ammonia production rates at ambient pressure between 50 and 300oC.\u00a0 This class of materials will be sought further developed and experimentally verified. In addition, the work will address how metal halide salts (e.g. MnCl2)) can be used to improve overall ammonia production rates. Such salts can benefit ammonia synthesis by reducing the ammonia activity during synthesis and thereby boost the formation rate. One can also use such salts for capturing ammonia from gas mixtures where it is present in low concentration e.g. from a low temperature synthesis route of poor selectivity. The captured ammonia can later be extracted in concentrated form by a pressure swing or temperature swing type operation. Such operation mode will be well suited for intermittent operation in a system with varying electricity cost.\u00a0 \nThe project will be carried out in close collaboration with the theory groups in the Villum Center V-SUSTAIN, that work on the fundamental description of the reaction pathway and on identifying novel and superior catalysts. It is an aim to verify experimentally, novel catalysts predicted from these materials modelling activities. \n\nYour research will include establishing/modifying setups for characterising ammonia synthesis involving use of auxiliary ammonia getter materials. \nYour research will include experimental characterisation of reaction kinetics\u00a0 \u00a0\nYour tasks will involve detailed materials characterisation and synthesis of novel catalyst materials. \nAs part of the PhD education, you will follow courses and assist in teaching activities\nYou are expected to spend at least 3 months at a foreign research institution\nYou will disseminate your work in international peer reviewed journals and at professional conferences.\n\nCandidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.\nWe favour candidates with a degree in chemical engineering, chemistry, physics or materials science or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a master's degree in engineering. Experience with one or more of the following areas is considered an advantage; \n\nMaterials synthesis, \nExperimental characterisation of reaction kinetics \nMaterials characterisation \nHeterogeneous catalysis and/or electrochemistry\n\nMoreover, the successful candidate\n\nis innovative and able to work in cross-disciplinary teams \nhas good communication skills in English, both written and spoken\nis able to work independently and take responsibility for the progress and quality of projects.\n\nApproval and Enrolment \nThe scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. \nAssessment\nYour application will be assessed by Professor Peter Vang Hendriksen and Dev.

The position is at the Section for Microbial Ecology and Biotechnology https://plen.ku.dk/forskning/mikrobiel-oekologi-og-bioteknologi/, and initially anchored in the Environmental Microbial Genomics (EMG) group headed by Professor Lars Hestbjerg Hansen.\nThe genetic context of e.g. secondary metabolites, antibiotic resistance genes or pesticide degradation genes is hugely important to their actual function. This context-driven approach is still underexplored in microbial genomics, but important in order to exploit the real potential of microbial solutions for societal challenges.\nTo address this developing field of microbial genomics, we are seeking a candidate with a research background in microbial genomics, bioinformatics and sequencing technologies in a microbial ecology and biotechnology context. With this position, we would like to strengthen research in all aspects of microbial genetics, with special emphasis on genetic parasites (plasmids, phages, transposons etc.) and their bacterial interactions, and involvement of these parasites in the active genetic development of antifungal properties, antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic degradation pathways and other functions relevant to humans and the environment. As part of the section\u2019s strategy, the tenure track assistant professor will work towards establishing an independent research group, focusing on studying microbial genome evolution, genetic parasites and their impact on important phenotypic traits. \nThe candidate will be expected to conduct independent research at the highest international level and establish his/her own research program within the area of microbial genetics, supported by external funding. As part of providing research-based teaching, the teaching obligations will be within microbiology, bioinformatics and microbial genetics at all levels. It will be an advantage that the candidate has teaching experience from relevant courses, and it is expected that the candidate will undergo necessary pedagogical training. For non-native Danish speakers, it is furthermore expected that the candidate will be able to teach in Danish after three years. \u00a0\nThe candidate is expected to be enthusiastic about working in an interdisciplinary academic environment. The position, therefore, requires a highly motivated scientist who is comfortable working in teams, have good interpersonal skills, as well as a collaborative and open mind-set. It is expected that the candidate develops leadership skills with the aim of gradually taking on administrative duties as required e.g. research group leader and other departmental services.\nResearch and teaching at the Department of Plant and Environmental Science, focus on plants, animals, soil, and microorganisms \u2013 from molecules through organisms to populations and anthropogenic ecosystems. The institute hosts state-of-the-art infrastructure, field research facilities, and many opportunities for collaborations within the department. It is our vision to maintain and develop our position as one of the principal centres for solving global challenges within agriculture, climate and plant science, based on excellent basic and applied research.\nThe Section for Microbial Ecology and Biotechnology conducts research in the areas of microbial ecology, environmental microbiology and microbial biotechnology. We aim to understand and exploit microbial diversity and interactions from both a genetic and ecological perspective and deliver basic knowledge as well as applied solutions to challenges within environmental pollution, plant production, aquaculture production and microbial ecosystem services. \n\nQualifications\n\nA Ph.D. or similar qualifications within virology, microbiology, biotechnology or other relevant research fields\nThree to seven years of post-graduate research experience within microbial genomics and bioinformatics\nAn internationally competitive research output documented by a substantial number of co-authored scientific papers in internationally recognized journals, and experience in grant writing to attract external funding within the field of microbial genomics and genetic context-driven research. \nExtensive experience within Illumina and Nanopore sequencing (from library building to bioinformatics analysis) is desirable, with emphasis on non-standard applications on the Nanopore platform. \nA documented experience with teaching at the university level will be considered an advantage, as well as commitment to teach.\nCommitment to and interest in the continued development of courses within the research area, and supervision at the BSc and MSc level\nGood collaborative skills and a record of collaborative projects with academic or external stakeholders.\nExperience with outreach activities and communication of research to the public via e.g., popular science articles.\nCommitment to and interest in taking on administrative duties as required, e.g., as research group leader and other departmental services.\nCommitment to achieve fluency in Danish as soon as possible, and no later than within 3 years (BSc level courses are taught in Danish).\n\n\u00a0\nAssessment of applicants will primarily consider their level of documented, internationally competitive research. The experience in grant writing to attract external funding will be strongly considered together with outreach qualifications. Teaching experience and formal didactic training are not mandatory but documented teaching qualifications/formal didactic training and teaching experience will be considered.\n\nSix overall criteria apply for assistant professor appointments at the University of Copenhagen. The six criteria (research, teaching, societal impact, organisational contribution, external funding and leadership) are considered a framework for the overall assessment of candidates. Furthermore, each candidate must be assessed according to the specific requirements stated in the job advertisement.
